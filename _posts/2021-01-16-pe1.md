Natural number that is a multiple of 3 or 5 can be represented as $$3n$$ or $$5n$$ . This means we have 333 multiple of 3 since $$1 < 3n < 1000$$ gives $$n \in [1, 333]$$, and similarly $$5n < 1000$$ gives $$n \in [1, 199]$$ . However this has a double-count of numbers that are mulitple of 15. Using piegon-hole principle, this gives

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{333} 3i + \sum_{i=1}^{199} 5i - \sum_{i=1}^{66} 15i = 3\times\frac{333(1+333)}{2} + 5\times\frac{199(1+199)}{2} - 15\times\frac{66(1+66)}{2} = \fbox{233168}
$$
