The 5th problem is about prime number again. The [problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5) states:

> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
>
> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

This problem can be solved with paper and pencil.

First of all, such number must contains all the prime numbers under 20:


$$
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19
$$


This list already has a good coverage of numbers below 20, but there are still some missing numbers such as 4, 8, ... We just have to find the largest $$k$$ for each prime $$p$$ above, such that $$p^k < 20$$. There's not many of them. We have  $$2^4=16$$, and $$3^2 = 9$$, and that's all, because the next prime number $$5^2 = 25 > 20$$.

Put everything together, we have


$$
2^4\times3^2\times5\times7\times11\times13\times15\times17\times19 = \fbox{232792560}.
$$
