Happy New Year 2021 :fireworks: Here comes my very first post on this blog. 

In 2012, while I was an undergraduate student, I came across [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) while I was reading one of my favorite blogs [Matrix67: The Aha Moments](http://www.matrix67.com/blog/). The problems in Project Euler attracted me a lot because sovling these problem requires a combination of algorithmic thinking and mathematical insight. I still remeber spending a few days working on these problems day and night, and after solving about 20 problems, I got stuck somewhere...

Time flies, and eight year has past since then. The world has changed quite a bit, especially in 2020. During the Christmas holiday last year, I was trying to find something to kill my leisure time (thanks to Covid-19), and magically Project Euler come to my mind. Unfortunately, I forgot my password, and apparently I didn't setup a recovery key at that time. This forces me to creat a new account in the end. Since this is a fresh start, I made a 2021 new year resolution to crack the first 100 problems, and write a post for each of them. On one hand, I am curious that over the years, whether my problem solving skill has been improved or not. On the other hand, I would like to share my learnings while cracking through these interesting problems.

In my posts, I will try to avoid giving out code that you can just take and run, unless it's really simple. There are already tons of solutions available on the Internet ([example](https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions)), and I would encourage folks to practice coding themselves. Instead, I will try to layout the ideas and the mathematics behind the problem. Many problems in Project Euler can be brute-forced, but finding a more efficient algorithm often requires some math work. If possible, I will try to present multiple approaches to illustrate the beauty and power of mathematics. Surprisingly, you will find out that some of the problems can even be solved with a calculator that you used in high school.

Now let's get started!
