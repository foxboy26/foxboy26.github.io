The 6th problem is about summation. The [problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6) states:

> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
> 
> $$
> 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
> $$
> 
>
> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
> 
> $$
> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
> $$
> 
>
> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $$3025 - 385 = 2640$$.
>
> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

The simplest way is probably a one line Python code:

```python
sum(range(101)) * sum(range(101)) - sum([i*i for i in range(101)])
```

## A Mathematical Approach

These two summations can also be computed directly.

First, square of the sum of the first $$n$$ natural numbers


$$
S_n = \left(\sum_{i=1}^ni\right)^2 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
$$


Then, the sum of the squares of the first $$n$$ natual numbers 


$$
T_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n}i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$


Now, the answer can simply be computed using a calculator easily. We have $$S_{100} - T_{100} = \fbox{25164150}$$.

You might notice that $$S_n$$ grows than $$T_n$$ when $$n$$ becomes large. One way to explain this is to compare the highest term for $$S_n$$ and $$T_n$$, and notice that the highest term for $$S_n$$ is $$n^4$$. Alternatively, if you know that


$$
S_n = \left(\sum_{i=1}^ni\right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n i^3
$$


It becomes obvious that $$S_n > T_n$$.
