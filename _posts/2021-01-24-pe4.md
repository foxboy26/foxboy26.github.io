The 4th problem is about palindrome number. The [problem](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4) states:

> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is $$9009 = 91 \times 99$$.
>
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.0

First, to check if a number is a palindrome, one way is to convert it directly into a string and check if the reverse is the same as the origin. This is probably the easiest way if you are using a dynamic language like Python.

```python
def IsPalindrome(n):
	return str(n)[::-1] == str(n)
```

An alternative way is to figure out each digit of $$n$$ by dividing 10 and find the reminder repeatedly.

Since there are only 900 3-digit numbers, the search space is small enough that we can just brute-force it. We only have to check $$\frac{900 \times 900}{2} = 405000 $$ number pairs. Using our brute-force algorithm, we find the largest palindrome product is


$$
913 \times 993 = 906609
$$


One way to speed it up is to notice that the palindrome product must have 6 digits, and thus it can be represented as $$ n = \overline{abccba} = 10^5a+10^4b+10^3c+10^2c+10b+a = 11(9011a+7\times11\times13\times10b+11\times10^2c)$$. Since 11 is a prime number, this means one of the number must be a multiple of 11. This can help reduce the search space by 11x.
